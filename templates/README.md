## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository was generated **automatically** using a script and contains **synthetic commit history**.
It is intended for **educational, experimental, and satirical purposes only**.

Do **not** use this to misrepresent your actual contributions on GitHub or in professional contexts — doing so may be considered misleading or fraudulent.

Instead, use it to:

- Explore Git internals
- Learn about commit metadata
- Understand why quality > quantity in software development
