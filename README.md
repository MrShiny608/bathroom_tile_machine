**Bathroom Tile Machine** is a satire project that generates a Git repository filled with fake commits ‚Äî all for the purpose of painting your GitHub contribution graph green like a perfectly tiled bathroom wall.

This project is a commentary on the absurd idea that commit frequency is a reliable measure of developer skill. Spoiler: it's not.
